# opaquebind
These are a set of opionated bindings for [`opaque-ke`](https://github.com/facebook/opaque-ke) developed specifically for a Python webserver and React SPA combination.

See [`opaquebind/README.md`](https://github.com/tiptenbrink/opaquebind/blob/main/opaquebind/README.md) for more detail on the exact choice of primitives. This library mostly consists of serialization/deserialization to/from base64url wrappers for the underlying functions of the `opaque-ke` library.
